  Laurie Learning Project
</h1>

This project is based on the Gatsby starter template. Please follow the instructions below and make sure that you can execute the project.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Navigate to project folder.**

   Navigate into this project's root directory.

   ```sh
   cd twilio-demo/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies.**

Npm requires a current version of node to be installed on your computer. If this is not already the case more instructions can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Start up the project.**

   Start up the project! Note that gatsby uses different commands than many front end projects and make sure to follow the direction below.

   ```sh
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

   Open the `twilio-demo` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
